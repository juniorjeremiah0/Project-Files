            </figure>
            <p>My name is Jeremiah Junior, and I am currently working towards completing an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) in Computer Support. This degree is a step in my journey to solidify my foundational IT skills and build a rewarding career in technology.</p>
            <p>Originally, I started as an intern in the IT field, learning on the job and gaining practical skills. Over time, I discovered a strong interest in audio-visual technology, which combines hands-on work with technical problem-solving. Now, in my professional role, I get to tackle technical challenges daily, which keeps me motivated and engaged.</p>
            <p>In addition to my work, I’m also committed to continual learning. This class is one part of that commitment, helping me gain new skills and broaden my understanding of web development. Each lesson brings me one step closer to my goal of becoming a well-rounded IT professional.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The avatar I chose symbolizes resilience and adaptability. Just like in the IT field, where technology is constantly evolving, my avatar reminds me to stay flexible and ready to tackle new challenges. This representation aligns with my personal growth as I strive to overcome obstacles in both my studies and my career.</p>
            <p>My avatar also reflects my passion for technology and the creativity involved in solving complex problems. In many ways, it’s a reminder to embrace new perspectives, learn from each experience, and push the boundaries of what’s possible. Through this symbolic representation, I’m inspired to keep improving and never settle for less.</p>

            <p>Since beginning this course, I have been introduced to the basics of HTML, CSS, and web development practices. Learning to structure a webpage, organize content, and apply semantic tags has been invaluable. Understanding how to format content correctly ensures that webpages are accessible and easy to maintain.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I’ve been practicing using inline elements like <strong>strong</strong> and <em>emphasis</em> tags to highlight important parts of text. These elements allow me to add subtle stylistic touches that enhance readability and engagement. Mastering these basics has been challenging but rewarding, and I feel more confident in my ability to build professional-looking web pages as a result.</p>
            <p>Beyond HTML, I am also learning the fundamentals of version control using Git and GitHub, which are essential skills for any IT professional. Through Git, I can track changes in my code, collaborate more effectively, and manage multiple versions of my project. This practical knowledge will benefit me not only in web development but also in other IT areas where version control is crucial.</p>
